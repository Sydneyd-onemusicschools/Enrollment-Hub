Enrollment Hub — GitHub Pages Upload Guide

Files to upload to your GitHub repository (root of the repo):
- index.html                  ← Home (wired)
- home_with_admin_pill_WIRED.html  ← (kept for internal links)
- admin_access_WIRED.html
- admin_dashboard_COMMAND_CENTER_smooth_WIRED.html
- studios_directory_WIRED.html
- studio_info_Danbury_full_with_rentals_section_pricing_top_WIRED.html

Steps:
1) Create a public repo on GitHub, e.g., enrollment-hub
2) Upload ALL the files above to the root of the repo
3) In GitHub, go to: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main, Folder: /(root) → Save
4) Your site will publish at: https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/
   - Home loads from index.html
   - All navigation between pages is already wired with relative links
